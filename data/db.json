      "title": "Scaling Ethereum With ZkSync",
      "body": "While scaling Ethereum has been a conversation since the protocol was born, the popularity of DeFi and NFTs has made it an urgent concern. A superior financial system needs to remain accessible and low cost for all. While ETH 2.0 will go a long way in getting us there, that roadmap is still unfolding, and the time for layer-2 (L2) solutions is now. \n\nWinning L2 solutions should maintain all the properties that make Ethereum great — permissionless, secure, community-owned — at lower cost than the base chain. To date, the mixture of maturity and tradeoffs found in competing designs has created a conundrum for the community: we could either choose the superior security, throughput, and capital efficiency of ZK rollups (ZKRs), or the EVM compatibility of less-secure fraud-proof systems like Optimistic rollups (ORs). The risk we face is that some teams choose the former, while others choose the latter, prioritizing different tradeoffs, fragmenting liquidity, and breaking composability.\n\nIt would be far easier if we weren’t forced to choose at all—if we could have the security, throughput, and efficiency of ZKRs alongside EVM compatibility, making it easier to converge on a common standard. Turns out, that’s zkSync 2.0, with the zkEVM. Yes, zkSync 2.0 is EVM compatible, and shipping in Q4 2021. \n\nFor those that can’t wait, there’s already zkSync 1.x, which provides permissionless ERC-20 token listings and support for NFTs. Live since June 2020, the original zkSync has had the lowest real transaction costs across all existing and planned rollups, leading teams like Gitcoin, Argent, and Index Coop to trust zkSync with their scaling needs.\n\nzkSync best preserves the properties that have made Ethereum successful thus far: decentralization, security, composability, capital efficiency, and instant withdrawals. At the same time, it minimizes the disruption faced by developers who are used to building contracts for the EVM. As a result, we believe zkSync paves the smoothest path to scaling DeFi, NFTs, and all other innovations happening on Ethereum.\n\nBefore we get into specifics, it’s worth reflecting on how we got here. This discussion points to the conclusion that the challenge ahead is not only to scale, but to do so in a way that safeguards the core properties that got Ethereum this far.",

      "title": "Element Thesis",
      "body": "Yield is one of the most important primitives in financial markets. Alongside gains, it’s an expression of investment profits. But whereas gains come from changes in the price of an asset – and are only realized when the asset is sold – yield is a measure of cash flows generated and distributed to the asset’s holder. They are different things, but yield informs the price of an asset and vice versa.\n\nFor example, you can profit from an investment in a company’s stock by selling shares at a higher price (gains) or when the company distributes excess profits in the form of dividends (yield). You may then value the stock as a function of its cash flows, as is common in securities analysis. Similarly, the interest rate paid by a borrower in a loan contract is the yield earned by the lender, and the market value of that contract is a function of its expected yield. Yield is expressed in percentage terms: a division of cash flows by the size of the underlying investment (e.g. a $100,000 investment that produces cash flows of $5,000 per year, yields 5%).\n\nYield is how many DeFi protocols reward active participants. For example, decentralized exchanges like 0x, Uniswap, and Balancer compensate market makers and liquidity providers who stake in those protocols with income derived from trading fees. Credit marketplaces like Aave and Compound pay lenders much of the interest rate paid by borrowers, and “robo-advisors” like Yearn maximize yield across a variety of underlying strategies. You may also earn yield from Proof-of-Stake systems like ETH2 or Decred. \n\nWhen you stake in most DeFi protocols you get back tokens that are redeemable for your initial deposit plus any yield generated throughout the duration of your stake. In Aave, these are “a-tokens”, in Compound “c-tokens”, and in most AMM dexes these are called “LP” tokens. But these come with capital-efficiency problems. First, the yield rates are usually market-based and thus variable and often volatile, so you have no certainty about the ultimate value until redemption. Second, your deposit is locked for the duration of your stake. It’s still yours, but you can’t use it elsewhere for the duration of your deposit.\n\nFor example, if you stake 10,000 USDC in Aave, the current annual yield (as of writing) is about 8.92% – but there’s no way to know if the next three or six months will yield more or less. You have no access to your principal (the 10,000 USDC deposit) while it’s staked in the protocol, which prevents you from leveraging that capital elsewhere. \n\nElement is a protocol that allows developers and investors to harness the power of yield in their applications and strategies by addressing these two issues as a layer on top of yield-generating protocols. It works by separating the principal from the interest of a given stake into two separate, tradable tokens: Principal Tokens and Interest Tokens. At the end of a set term (e.g. 3 or 6 months) your each Principal Token is redeemable for a proportional share of the initial stake, while your Interest Tokens are redeemable for the yield generated by the principal over the same time period.\n\nFor example, if you pursued the same 10,000 USDC Aave strategy through Element over a 12-month term, you would get 10,000 Principal Tokens redeemable for 10,000 USDC in a year, and 10,000 Interest Tokens redeemable for however much interest is generated on Aave over that year. If the average rate turned out to be 10%, then the interest tokens would have a terminal value of about 1,000 USDC (or 0.1 USDC per Interest Token). \n\nIt’s a powerful trick. Here are just a few things you can do once you separate the yield from the principal:\n\nFirst, your principal interest is now liquid. Keeping our example, your 10,000 USDC is still locked in Aave for a year, but you now have an equivalent amount of Principal Tokens which you can sell at a discount to account for the lockup. The market might be interested in buying your 10,000 USDC principal tokens for 9,400 USDC, thus securing a fixed yield of 6%. This new instrument solves the problem of unknown yield. ",

      "title": "The Original Sin",
      "body": "This piece is about one thing: what is the initial distribution of the capital that underpins a cryptonetwork? In a recent conversation between the Placeholder and USV teams, Fred Wilson commented that with organizations he’s experienced going south over time it can often be traced back to an original sin at inception (team, approach, economics or any other pivotal decision). For crypto, an original sin we regularly observe is insiders owning too much of systems that are marketed as public, egalitarian networks. \n\nWhile “fair distribution” is a normative judgment, it flows from what we see as a consensus belief within crypto: creating level playing-fields where everyone has a chance at financial sovereignty. If a small group of insiders regularly take ~half of the fully-diluted upside (which is common), we’re seriously kneecapping the redistributive effects of this technology in order to make a handful of people obscenely rich. Truth is, those people are going to do phenomenally well even if they took less, they are just autopilot taking as much as they can, justifying it with “this is how things have always been done” or false claims of “muh fiduciary duty.” \n\nWe are working to build permissionless, open tech. Most of the process is open, but the part that remains the most closed and shrouded in secrecy is the early-stage financing. While this is in-part regulatorily and social norms driven, the more sinister component is insiders can disproportionately tilt the scales in their favor while keeping the details hidden from public view. The more early-stage investors get away with edgy behavior, the more emboldened and empowered they become, to the point where this power becomes detrimental to the health of the space as a whole. \n\nUnder the veil of this opacity the same norms and structures that have imbalanced past wealth and power distributions are at play. If we don’t openly address what’s going on at the inception of cryptonetworks, then we are bound to repeat the same past societal mistakes. \n\nWhere the capital accrues, so too will the power.\n\nThe two groups of individuals most intimately involved in the initial creation and distribution of capital are entrepreneurs and early-stage investors (either in VC, HF, or hybrid structures in crypto). Entrepreneurs want to build something, and unless they have the money to support themselves and their team independently, they turn to early-stage investors that fork over risk capital to fund the journey. While crypto has often demonized this process, it can be a healthy and helpful one that allows an entrepreneur with zero wealth to take risk on an idea and if it succeeds, get significant upside, and if it fails, walk off into the sunset without indentured servitude.\n\nThere is another world though where the relationship becomes unhealthy, especially in situations where there’s an opportunistic investor that is aware of the asymmetric distribution of information between the investor and entrepreneur, combined with an inexperienced entrepreneur. First-time entrepreneurs, beware. We have seen it frequently enough, in enough deals, to know that predatory behavior at the early-stage is more common than it should be in crypto.\n\nThis asymmetric upper hand gives the investor home-field advantage, and so long as they are able to get the entrepreneur to agree to legal agreements before any other investor says those agreements are unreasonable, then an entrepreneur can agree and the network runs the risk of being forever imbalanced from this original sin. \n\nAs an entrepreneur, a great resource to protect oneself is other entrepreneurs who have already gone through fundraises. Ask them about the reputations of different investors, things they regret, what they deem as fair, etc. If you’re considering a lead investor, you should be able to talk with any network(s) from that investor’s portfolio to get references on the investor -- references need not be one-sided. Furthermore, try to get more than one term sheet, if you can. These are a couple of simple steps to protect yourself as an entrepreneur. ",

      "title": "Replicating Market Makers",
      "body": "We present a method for constructing Constant Function Market Makers (CFMMs) whose portfolio value functions matches a desired payoff. More specifically, we show that the space of concave, nonnegative, nondecreasing, 1-homogeneous payoff functions and the space of convex CFMMs are equivalent; in other words, every CFMM has a concave, nonnegative, nondecreasing, 1-homogeneous payoff function, and every payoff function with these properties has a corresponding convex CFMM. We demonstrate a simple method for recovering a CFMM trading function that produces this desired payoff. This method uses only basic tools from convex analysis and is intimately related to Fenchel conjugacy. We demonstrate our result by constructing trading functions corresponding to basic payoffs, as well as standard financial derivatives such as options and swaps.",
